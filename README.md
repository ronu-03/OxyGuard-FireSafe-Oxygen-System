# OxyGuard – Smart Oxygen Control System 🚨🔥💨

## 📌 Overview
**OxyGuard** is an innovative **software simulation** of a smart oxygen supply system for vehicles.  
It is designed to **help people trapped inside cars** by detecting occupants and air quality, and supplying oxygen when needed.  

⚠️ But, in the case of **fire accidents**, the system **automatically disables oxygen supply** to prevent the flames from spreading.  

This upgraded version of **OxySense** ensures **life safety and fire prevention** in emergency scenarios.

## 🛠️ Features
- ✅ Detects **occupants** inside the car  
- ✅ Monitors **air quality** (low oxygen, poor air)  
- ✅ Supplies oxygen during emergencies  
- ✅ **Fire detection logic** – disables oxygen valve for safety  
- ✅ **Alert system** with GUI notifications  
- 🔊 Plays **fire alert sound** when fire is detected

🔮 Future Improvements

🚘 Real-time integration with car sensors

📡 IoT alerts to emergency contacts

🔋 Backup battery support for emergencies

📝 Note

This is a software simulation of the system.
Hardware implementation would require sensors (occupant, gas, fire), microcontroller, solenoid valve, and ventilation system.
